# Social-Media-App
The project for the Course: COMP132 - Advanced Programming (Spring22). 
Source code will be added after I will recieve the permission to publish.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This repository is my own work when I was taking COMP132, the theme for Spring22 term was to build a social media app using Java Swing components.
- My repository is free to use; however, do not directly copy and paste the codes, instead try to understand why it works and implement it on your own project.
- I was also an active Teaching Assistant for that course, so beware that directly copying and pasting can lead to plagiarism and an instant fail in the Course (or maybe worse.)
- This is just for reference/help for the students having difficulty, try to understand my implementation, adapt it to your case.
